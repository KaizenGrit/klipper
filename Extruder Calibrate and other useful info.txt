 docs/prints/square_tower.stl. Use a high speed (eg, 100mm/s), zero infill, and a coarse layer height (the layer height should be around 75% of the nozzle diameter)

The pressure_advance value can then be calculated as pressure_advance = <start> + <measured_height> * <factor>. (For example, 0 + 12.90 * .020 would be .258.)

Suggested layer height is 0.2 or 0.25 mm.
Infill and top layers can be set to 0.
vase mode with 1-2 mm base.
80-100 mm/sec, for external perimeters.
minimum layer time is at most 3 seconds.
“dynamic acceleration control” is disabled in the slicer.
Do not turn the model

Increase max_accel and max_accel_to_decel parameters in your printer.cfg to 7000. Note that this is only needed for tuning, and more proper value will be selected in the corresponding section.
If square_corner_velocity parameter was changed, revert it back to 5.0. It is not advised to increase it when using the input shaper because it can cause more smoothing in parts - it is better to use higher acceleration value instead.
Restart the firmware: RESTART.

Print the test model sliced with the suggested parameters.

Count how many oscillations N the measured distance D corresponds to. If you are unsure how to count the oscillations, refer to the picture above, which shows N = 6 oscillations.
Compute the ringing frequency of X axis as V · N / D (Hz), where V is the velocity for outer perimeters (mm/sec). For the example above, we marked 6 oscillations, and the test was printed at 

100 mm/sec velocity, so the frequency is 100 * 6 / 12.14 ≈ 49.4 Hz.

Do (9) - (11) for Y mark as well.

TESTZ Z=+ or -
TESTZ Z=+ or TESTZ Z=- to “bisect” the last position 

Then a TESTZ Z=- would move the nozzle to a Z position of 0.180 (half way between 0.130 and 0.230). One can use this feature to help rapidly narrow down to a consistent friction. It is also possible to use Z=++ and Z=-- to return directly to a past measurement - for example, after the above prompt a TESTZ Z=-- command would move the nozzle to a Z position of 0.130.

After finding a small amount of friction run the ACCEPT command:

ACCEPT
