# This is my printer config with lots of borrows from other members 
# work. See the includes below and the according files for more parameter.  I 
# separated this to shorten and clean up my main config file.  I'm a noob, 
# so you are likely to see a decent amount of crap.  Still unsure about the 
# stepper currents I have set.  I had them a .66 run current and they were 
# all very hot to touch.  I expect the extruder stepper will always be super 
# hot, as klipper drives the crap out of it.
